YAML File Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ is a data serialization format and it is supported by the major programming languages.
*geomdl-cli* uses YAML format to input single or multiple NURBS shapes.
`NURBS-Python (geomdl) <https://github.com/orbingol/NURBS-Python>`_ also supports exporting NURBS data to YAML format
with the function
`export_yaml() <https://nurbs-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_exchange.html#geomdl.exchange.export_yaml>`_

Defining YAML files for curves
==============================

THe following example illustrates a 2-dimensional NURBS curve. 3-dimensional NURBS curves are also supported and they
can be generated by updating the control points.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # 2-dimensional NURBS curve
    shape:
      type: curve
      data:
        - degree: 2
          knotvector: [0, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.75, 1, 1, 1]
          control_points:
            points:
              - [0.0, -1.0]
              - [-1.0, -1.0]
              - [-1.0, 0.0]
              - [-1.0, 1.0]
              - [0.0, 1.0]
              - [1.0, 1.0]
              - [1.0, 0.0]
              - [1.0, -1.0]
              - [0.0, -1.0]
            weights:
              - 1.0
              - 0.707
              - 1.0
              - 0.707
              - 1.0
              - 0.707
              - 1.0
              - 0.707
              - 1.0
          delta: 0.01

Shape section
-------------

This section contains the single or multi NURBS data. ``type`` and ``data`` sections are mandatory.

Type section
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines the type of the NURBS shape. For NURBS curves, it should be set to *curve*.

Data section
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section defines the NURBS data, i.e. degrees, knot vectors and control_points. ``weights`` and ``delta`` sections
are optional.

Defining YAML files for surfaces
================================

THe following examples illustrates a NURBS surface:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # NURBS surface
    shape:
      type: surface
      data:
        - degree_u: 1  # degree of the u-direction
          degree_v: 2  # degree of the v-direction
          knotvector_u: [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]
          knotvector_v: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
          size_u: 2  # number of control points on the u-direction
          size_v: 9  # number of control points on the v-direction
          control_points:
            points:
              - [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
              - [1.0, 1.0, 0.0]
              - [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
              - [-1.0, 1.0, 0.0]
              - [-1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
              - [-1.0, -1.0, 0.0]
              - [0.0, -1.0, 0.0]
              - [1.0, -1.0, 0.0]
              - [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
              - [1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
              - [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
              - [0.0, 1.0, 1.0]
              - [-1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
              - [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
              - [-1.0, -1.0, 1.0]
              - [0.0, -1.0, 1.0]
              - [1.0, -1.0, 1.0]
              - [1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
            weights:
              - 1.0
              - 0.7071
              - 1.0
              - 0.7071
              - 1.0
              - 0.7071
              - 1.0
              - 0.7071
              - 1.0
              - 1.0
              - 0.7071
              - 1.0
              - 0.7071
              - 1.0
              - 0.7071
              - 1.0
              - 0.7071
              - 1.0
          delta:
              - 0.05  # evaluation delta of the u-direction
              - 0.05  # evaluation delta of the v-direction

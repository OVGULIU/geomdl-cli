Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

geomdl-cli allows users to override existing commands and configuration variables with and option add custom commands
and configuration variables for the custom commands as well.

These changes can be directly applied by creating a special directory, ``.geomdl-cli``. geomdl-cli will automatically
check the existence of this directory in the following locations:

* user home directory (e.g. ``/home/user/.geomdl-cli``, ``C:\Users\user\.geomdl-cli``)
* directory that you are running geomdl-cli

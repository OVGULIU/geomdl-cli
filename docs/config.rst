Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to add custom commands to *geomdl-cli* without changing the base code by creating a special directory,
``.geomdl-cli``. *geomdl-cli* will automatically check the existence of this directory in the following locations:

* user home directory
* directory that you are running *geomdl-cli* application

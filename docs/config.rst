Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to add custom commands to *geomdl-cli* without changing the base code by creating a special directory,
``.geomdl-cli``. geomdl-cli will automatically check the existence of this directory in the following locations:

* user home directory (e.g. ``/home/user/.geomdl-cli``, ``C:\Users\user\.geomdl-cli``)
* directory that you are running geomdl-cli

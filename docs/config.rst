Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

geomdl-cli allows users to override existing commands and configuration variables with and option add custom commands
and configuration variables for the custom commands as well.

These changes can be directly applied by creating a special directory, ``.geomdl-cli``. geomdl-cli automatically
checks for the existence of this directory in the following locations:

* user home directory (e.g. ``/home/user/.geomdl-cli``, ``C:\Users\user\.geomdl-cli``)
* directory that you are running geomdl-cli

In the listed directories, geomdl-cli tries to load the custom configuration file ``config.json`` which is in JSON format
with special directives discussed below. If the file doesn't exist, geomdl-cli will continue working without any problems.

The following sections discuss the details of the JSON file and the customization options.
